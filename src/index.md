# Welcome to Lea codes

Welcome to Lea's WebGL and Three.js world. On this page I will share various demos using WebGL technology.

This is a personal project documenting my learnings on WebGL and Three.js, so my future me doesn't forget about it.
My journey has just begun. Hopefully, this will end up as a valuable resource in the future.
