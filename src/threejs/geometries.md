## Geometries

Three.js provides several built-in primitive objects you can use in your scene, these include planes, spheres, boxes and many more shapes.

To add a primitive object to the scene, you will need to choose a material and geometry and provide it
in the `Mesh` constructor arguments.

### Example

```js
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// specify a sphere with radius 1 and 16 sides, 16 segments
const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 16, 16);

// Choose a material (MeshBasicMaterial is the simplest choice, it ignores lighting)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

scene.add(mesh);
```

### Geometry vs BufferGeometry

All primitive geometries are available as a [`Geometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Geometry) and as a [`BufferGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/BufferGeometry).

The [`Geometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Geometry) based classes are more user-friendly, whereas the [`BufferGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/BufferGeometry) based classes are more efficient.

### Building a geometry from scratch

A geometry consists of faces. Faces take 3 vertices for a triangle (using `Face3`).

Example by [@mattdesl](https://twitter.com/mattdesl/):

```js
// A custom geometry
const geometry = new THREE.Geometry();

// Define some vertices
geometry.vertices = [
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.5, 0.5, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(0.5, -0.5, 0),
  new THREE.Vector3(-0.5, -0.5, 0),
];

// Define some faces
geometry.faces = [new THREE.Face3(0, 1, 2)];

// Update the face normals
geometry.computeFaceNormals();
```

### Using SVG paths to create geometries

You can use the three.js [`Shape`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Shape) class to create a shape and then use a `ShapeGeometry` or `ExtrudeGeometry` to create a geometry from it.

The [example from the official the threejs site](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_geometry_extrude_shapes2.html) parses an SVG path string and converts it into a bunch of three.js [`Shape`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Shape) objects. It is based on a d3 plugin that is currently abandoned: [d3-threeD](https://github.com/asutherland/d3-threeD/blob/master/lib/d3-threeD.js).

### Using text and fonts to create geometries

Three.js provides a [`FontLoader`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/FontLoader) utility class. Fonts use a [`Font`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Font) data structure which is an array of [`Shape`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/extras/core/Shape) representing the font. The font file needs to be provided as a JSON file which can
be generated by [facetype.js](https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/).

To create a geometry from a font, you can use [`TextGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/TextGeometry) or [`TextBufferGeometry`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/TextGeometry)
